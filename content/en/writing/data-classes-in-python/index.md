Let's talk classes in *Python*. They're a great way to organized functions &
behaviors that center around a particular instance of data & functionality. A
simple class is with an `__init__` method to initialize some properties on the
instance. There are other **special methods** in *Python* like the `__repr__`
method to get a string representation of the class among others. Below I'll
break down what kinds of *special methods* you'll need to add to your class to
get the most out of using them & how to simplify writing classes when they're
centered around data specifically using *Data Classes*.

## Writing a data-driven class the long way

Okay, so bare with me here. The next few sections are going to show you how to
write a good-practice data-driven class without using the *Data Classes* library
in *Python* >= 3.7.

<details>
<summary>Curious to see <code>@dataclass</code> in action?</summary>

If you'd like to skip examples of *special methods* for a *Python* class without
*Data Classes* then [‚¨áÔ∏è you can skip to that section by clicking here][skip].

</details>

```python { title = "simple-flag.py" hl_lines = [ 3, 7 ] }
class SimpleFlag:
  """Class for setting up flag objects with a name & a status."""
  def __init__(self, name: str, is_active: bool):
    self.name: str = name
    self.is_active: bool = is_active

  def __repr__(self) -> str:
      a = self.is_active
      n = self.name
      return f'Simple Flag name: {n} & status: {a}'

  def toggle(self):
    self.is_active = not self.is_active
```

This works OK, but we aren't done!. There's a whole set of *special methods*
missing here that need to be implemented. Things like initializing & printing
values are the bare minimum here.

### Setting up equality checking

First, let's start with checking for equality. This is useful if we're passing
around flags & want to compare them to each other. Here's the code for adding
the `__eq__` & `__ne__` short for equal & not equal respectively.

```py { title = "Implementing equality too" verbatim = false hl_lines = [3,9] }
# ... further down `simple-flag.py`

  def __eq__(self, compa):
    if compa.__class__ is self.__class__:
      return (self.name, self.is_active) == (compa.name, compa.is_active)
    else:
      return NotImplemented

  def __ne__(self, compa):
    result = self.__eq__(compa)
    if result is NotImplemented:
      return NotImplemented
    else
      return not result
```

Now that we can compare instances of the `SimpleFlag`, we can think about
**hashability & making this class hashable**. In order to do that we'll need to
create a `__hash__` deterministic method that returns a value based on the
unique properties of the class.

<details>

<summary>üí° What's <strong>"hashable"</strong> mean for a class in <em>Python</em>?</summary>

### Understanding why **hashability** is important

To understand what a hashable object is in *Python*, let's define what
hashability means & why it's needed. You need to make your class hashable when
you will use instances as items in a dictionary or set. [*Python* includes a
`hash()` function][docs-hash-func] that you can use with arguments consisting of
properties of the class.

[docs-hash-func]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hash

[The `__hash__` special method][docs-hash-method] **needs to return an integer
with the same value every time** so it only works best when the arguments being
passed-in are immutable. To be able to use the `__hash__` method, you'll need to
implement a `__eq__` as well.

[docs-hash-method]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__

#### Practical uses for hashable classes

Having a hashable class is important so you can create class instances that can
be used as keys in dictionaries. This allows for efficient lookup & retrieval.
When using class instances in a set, you can then filter & de-duplicate data.
Lastly, hashable classes are needed for creating custom data structures such as
bloom filters & hash tables.

</details>

```py { title = "Implementing hashing also" verbatim = false hl_lines = [3] }
# ... even further down `simple-flag.py`

  def __hash__(self):
    return hash((self.__class__, self.name, self.is_active))
```

Now if we make the instance hashable, we have to initialize our class properties `name`
& `is_active` arguments immutable.

### Making properties immutable manually

Okay, so the next step is to re-write the `__init__` method & add the
`@property` decorator to new methods for the properties to be able to access
them.

```py { title = "Making properties immutable" verbatim = false hl_lines = [4,5,7,8,11,12] }
# ... making the new changes to `__init__` & adding property access methods

  def __init__(self, name: str, is_active: bool):
    self.__name: str = name
    self.__is_active: bool = is_active

  @property
  def name(self) -> str:
    return self.__name

  @property
  def is_active(self) -> bool:
    return self.__is_active
```

As you can see in the highlighted sections above, that's a lot to be adding to
this simple class, but so far we have immutability in our class, hashing in case
you want to store instances in a dictionary, along with checking for equality or
not, being able to print the values of the class in a string representation, &
initialization of the class.

Another thing to keep in mind here is that because we've used double-underscores
or dunders (`__`) as the prefix to our properties in the class, we now have to
modify our access of these properties in the class with the same prefix. For the
next change, I'll use the new `__` prefix when accessing the properties, but
keep in mind that you have to update how you access properties internally in the
class when you make properties immutable.

### Setting up comparison methods

We're still missing one major feature, & that's sorting. So we have to implement
those *special methods* as well below.


```py { title = "Implementing sorting as well" verbatim = false hl_lines = [3,9,15,21] }
# ... further still down `simple-flag.py`

  def __lt__(self, compa):
    if compa.__class__ is self.__class__:
      return (self.__name, self.__is_active) < (compa.__name, compa.__is_active)
    else:
      return NotImplemented

  def __le__(self, compa):
    if compa.__class__ is self.__class__:
      return (self.__name, self.__is_active) <= (compa.__name, compa.__is_active)
    else:
      return NotImplemented

  def __gt__(self, compa):
    if compa.__class__ is self.__class__:
      return (self.__name, self.__is_active) > (compa.__name, compa.__is_active)
    else:
      return NotImplemented

  def __ge__(self, compa):
    if compa.__class__ is self.__class__:
      return (self.__name, self.__is_active) >= (compa.__name, compa.__is_active)
    else:
      return NotImplemented

```

With those last changes, we now have a fully implemented class with the *special
methods* needed for **initializing**, **printing**, **sorting**, **comparing**,
& **hashability**. We're done with this class as long as none of the properties
need to be changed.

<details>
<summary>Check out the whole file for
  <code>simple-flag.py</code>.</summary>

Below I've highlighted all the *special methods* that have been added to
`simple-flag.py` in a single file. You can see that there are 11 methods that
were added to the class.

```py { title = "simple-flag.py" hl_lines = [3,"7-8", "11-12",15,23,29,36,39,45,51, 57] }
class SimpleFlag:
  """Class for setting up flag objects with a name & a status."""
  def __init__(self, name: str, is_active: bool):
    self.__name: str = name
    self.__is_active: bool = is_active

  @property
  def name(self) -> str:
    return self.__name

  @property
  def is_active(self) -> bool:
    return self.__is_active

  def __repr__(self) -> str:
      a = self.__is_active
      n = self.__name
      return f'Simple Flag name: {n} & status: {a}'

  def toggle(self):
    self.__is_active = not self.__is_active

  def __eq__(self, compa):
    if compa.__class__ is self.__class__:
      return (self.__name, self.__is_active) == (compa.__name, compa.__is_active)
    else:
      return NotImplemented

  def __ne__(self, compa):
    result = self.__eq__(compa)
    if result is NotImplemented:
      return NotImplemented
    else
      return not result

  def __hash__(self):
    return hash((self.__class__, self.__name, self.__is_active))

  def __lt__(self, compa):
    if compa.__class__ is self.__class__:
      return (self.__name, self.__is_active) < (compa.__name, compa.__is_active)
    else:
      return NotImplemented

  def __le__(self, compa):
    if compa.__class__ is self.__class__:
      return (self.__name, self.__is_active) <= (compa.__name, compa.__is_active)
    else:
      return NotImplemented

  def __gt__(self, compa):
    if compa.__class__ is self.__class__:
      return (self.__name, self.__is_active) > (compa.__name, compa.__is_active)
    else:
      return NotImplemented

  def __ge__(self, compa):
    if compa.__class__ is self.__class__:
      return (self.__name, self.__is_active) >= (compa.__name, compa.__is_active)
    else:
      return NotImplemented

```
</details>

### Adding more properties to the class

Now let's add a new feature to our `simple-flag.py` because tracking `name` &
`is_active` is not enough. We also want to track a new property named
`created_at`. In order to do this, you'll need to **modify nine methods** &
**add a new `@property` decorator to a new method** to return the immutable
`created_at` value. This would mean **modifying all the code that sets
properties & gets properties** from the class. It also means **all of the
comparison & hash methods will need to be modified**.

Taking the original `simple-flag.py` file & modifying it with all the changes I
mentioned produces a fairly large diff using `git diff --no-index --stat` for
just adding a single property.

As you can see below, there are a lot of modifications that need to be made just
because there was a single property added to the class. As more properties get
added to a class, you'll need to modify more & more sections of your class in
the similar ways.

</details>

Now **that's a lot** of changes to add or remove properties. It's easy to make a
mistake as well as you're finding & replacing text. Thankfully, there is a
better way to write classes in *Python* where these 11 methods & more are added
automatically. These classes are called *Data Classes*. They are a great way to
succinctly define classes that store data.

## Writing our `SimpleFlag` class with `dataclasses`

To write the same `simple-flag.py` class from above using the *Data Classes*
decorator, you will first notice that there is a lot less method definitions
involved.

[‚û°Ô∏è You can read all the *special methods* that get added to the class
automatically along with the arguments to the `@dataclass` decorator
here][docs-dcmethods].

[docs-dcmethods]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.dataclass

```py { title = "simple-flag.py" hl_lines = [4] }
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass()
class SimpleFlag:
  name: str
  is_active: bool
  created_at: datetime

  def toggle(self):
    self.is_active = not self.is_active
```

Your eyes aren't playing tricks on you. That's it. As [PEP 557][docs-pep557]
said, this is a convenient way to create classes. The `@dataclass` decorator
takes the type annotations from the class variables definitions & adds the
following *special methods* to our `SimpleFlag` instance.

- `__init__` - How the class gets initialized is taken care for us.
  - You can run your own code with `__post_init__` if you want to run something
    after the auto-created `__init__` method.
- `__repr__` - How the class is represented is taken care for us.
- `__eq__` - How the class is compared between instances is taken care for us.


#### Assigning default values

You can also assign default values to properties is straight-forward. Taking the
example above, let's add a default value of `False` to the `is_active` property
if it's not passed in.

```py { title = "default-value-simple-flag.py" hl_lines = [ 7 ] }
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass()
class SimpleFlag:
  name: str
  is_active: bool = True
  created_at: datetime

  def toggle(self):
    self.is_active = not self.is_active
```

### Adding immutability to *Data Classes*

Next, let's add immutability to `SimpleFlag` by passing the `frozen=True`
keyword argument into the decorator call.

```py { title = "immutable-simple-flag.py" hl_lines = [4] }
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SimpleFlag:
  name: str
  is_active: bool
  created_at: datetime

  def toggle(self):
    self.is_active = not self.is_active
```

Now the *Data Classes* library will add following *special methods* as well.

- `__eq__` - How the class is compared between instances is taken care for us.
- `__hash__` - How the class generates an integer hashed by the values of the
  instance to support using instances as keys in a dictionary or items in a set.
- `__setattr__` This is used to raise a `FrozenInstanceError` if it's called to
  set a value to an immutable property.
- `__delattr__` This is used to raise a `FrozenInstanceError` if `del` is called to
  delete an immutable property.

#### Modifying properties by creating new copies

With the `frozen=True` keyword argument in the decorator call for the *Data
Class*, you can't modify properties of an instance directly anymore. But. You
can create a copy with a different value for an immutable property like so.

```py { title = "replace-simple-flag.py" hl_lines = [16] }
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SimpleFlag:
  name: str
  is_active: bool
  created_at: datetime

  def toggle(self):
    self.is_active = not self.is_active


def main():
  prod_flag = SimpleFlag("prod", false, datetime.now())
  modified_prod_flag = dataclasses.replace(prod_flag, is_active=True)
```

With the `dataclasses.replace()` function, you pass in the class you'd like to
modify as the first argument with keyword arguments for the properties you'd
like to modify.

It is possible to still modify properties when the class has immutable
properties. There's an example [further along that shows how to modify a
property when `frozen=True` is passed into the decorator using the
`object.__setattr__` method][skip2].

[skip2]: {{< relref "writing/data-classes-in-python#setting-sort_index-when-the-class-is-immutable-simple-flag" >}}

### Adding ordering to *Data Classes*



```py { title = "ordered-simple-flag.py" hl_lines = [4] }
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass(order=True)
class SimpleFlag:
  name: str
  is_active: bool
  created_at: datetime

  def toggle(self):
    self.is_active = not self.is_active
```

All of the following *special methods* get generated. The comparison is done
between tuples of the classes fields, in order.

- `__ge__` - How the class runs a **rich comparison** for greater than or equal
comparisons.
- `__gt__` - How the class runs a **rich comparison** for greater than
comparisons.
- `__le__` - How the class runs a **rich comparison** for greater than or equal
comparisons.
- `__lt__` - How the class runs a **rich comparison** for greater than
comparisons.

#### Adding a `sort_index` to control ordering

While `order=True` writes our functions for us, we can still control ordering
operations by tying them to a particular property on the class.

```py { title = "ordered-with-index-simple-flag.py" hl_lines = [ 1,6,"14-15" ] }
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass(order=True)
class SimpleFlag:
  sort_index: int = field(init=False, repr=False)
  name: str
  is_active: bool
  created_at: datetime

  def toggle(self):
    self.is_active = not self.is_active

  def __post_init__(self):
    self.sort_index = self.created_at
```

Take a look at the highlighted sections above. First, we have to import a new
function from `dataclasses` called `field`. We need to this to control how the
`sort_order` property gets initialized and how it's represented in string form.
You can also see that there's a new *special method* that we need to add to our
class to run after the initializing step. This is where we set the value for
`sort_order` from the `created_at` property. This will now be the property that
is used in *rich comparisons* like, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`.

##### Setting `sort_index` when the class is immutable-simple-flag

If you're using `frozen=True` & `order=True` in the decorator, you won't be able
to set variables in the `__post_init__` method from above. You'll have to modify
the *special method* to use the `object.__setattr__` method.

```py { title = "ordered-index-frozen-simple-flag.py" hl_lines = [ 4, 15 ] }
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass(order=True, frozen=True)
class SimpleFlag:
  sort_index: int = field(init=False, repr=False)
  name: str
  is_active: bool
  created_at: datetime

  def toggle(self):
    self.is_active = not self.is_active

  def __post_init__(self):
    object.__setattr__(self, 'sort_index', self.created_at)
```

As you can see from the highlight above, the function signature is the object
(`self`), the property (`sort_index`), and the value (`self.created_at`) for
that property.

### Setting default values

With *Data Classes* you can also set defaults for properties of the class. You
may have noticed this in the example for the section [*Assigning default
values*][callback] where we made the `is_active` property have a default value
of `True`.

[callback]: {{< relref "writing/data-classes-in-python#assigning-default-values" >}}

While this works well with types such as `bool`, `str`, or `int`. But for types
like `dict`, `list`, or `set`, we will need to set it the value for the property
with the `field` function and the argument `default_factory=<type>`.

#### Creating properties that are unique to an instance

When working with *Data Classes*, you will have to use the `fields` function
from the `dataclasses` library to make certain mutable properties unique to the
instance. Bellow we'll create a new `tags` property that is a list of strings.

```py { title = "shared-list-simple-flags" hl_lines = [ 9 ] }
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass()
class SimpleFlag:
  name: str
  is_active: bool
  created_at: datetime
  tags: list[str] = []

  def toggle(self):
    self.is_active = not self.is_active
```

In this example above, the list will be shared across all instances of the
class. In order to make `tags` unique, we will need to import the `fields`
function from `dataclasses` and set a `default_factory` argument equal to the
`list` function in *Python*.

```py { title = "unique-list-simple-flags.py" hl_lines = [ 1, 9 ] }
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass()
class SimpleFlag:
  name: str
  is_active: bool
  created_at: datetime
  tags: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)

  def toggle(self):
    self.is_active = not self.is_active
```

With the highlighted code added above, you will now have the `tags` property
unique for each instance of `SimpleFlag`.

## Whew, & that's a wrap folks

I've covered a lot in this post. *Python* classes can be written in two distinct
ways such as a behavior-driven class or a data-driven class. If you're writing
the latter of these types, you will want to write much less boilerplate & use
the new `@dataclass` decorator to make the maintenance of *Python* classes much
easier without having to create *special methods* that could lead to mistakes if
they're written manually. Thanks for reading!
