Here you'll find lots of great information on how to work with *Linux* tools &
operating systems. Some of this can apply to *macOS* since its built on top of
the *Darwin* distribution. A lot of the posts are general topics but may also
dive deeply into a particular distribution. But if you're looking for specific
*Linux*-flavored writing for *macOS*, [you'll want to look here](/tags/mac/)
