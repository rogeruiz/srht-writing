These posts cover different aspects of *Nix* such as the programming language,
the operating system, home manager, and the *Darwin* configuration of *Nix*. I
like writing about *Nix* because it's a very different way of configuring &
packaging software. While my path learning *Nix* has been jumping right into the
deep-end, you'll find that some of my writing on this topic are geared towards
slowly adopting *Nix* into your software development process.
