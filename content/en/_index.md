I'm so glad you're here. This website is where I publish my technical writing
along with a deeper overview of my experience that I can't fit into my resume.

<details>
<summary>Curious readers should click here.</summary>

Oh, hi! Thanks for opening this. I wanted to highlight the variety of styles &
techniques that I use in my technical writing to make things easier to read.

An example is the heavy use of `<details />` HTML elements to allow readers to
dive deeper into certain topics. There's also the use of
[BeOS-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS) labels on multi-line `<code />`
blocks which help readers understand what the code is doing or what file is
being discussed. There's also the `backticks` present on inline code blocks as
well.

**I use underlines to strongly emphasize** certain text but *italics if
it's lightly emphasized*.

Also since I'm using [the *Catppuccin* theme][theme] for the website, you can
expect that links are colored blue if you can click them.

[theme]: https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin

Lastly, the colorful tags on the *Writing* pages will allow you to further filter
things into specific topics.

_Also_, this site is **bilingual, like me**. You can find a translation to
Spanish on the upper-right corner or the bottom of the page, if it's available.
If it's not, then {{< mailto
email="hi@rog.gr"
subject="Oye, parce. Quiero que escribas algo en espaÃ±ol" >}}
reach out to me{{</ mailto >}} so I know there's interest in it. For the most
part, I try to translate everything between the two languages to help spread my
reach across folks interested in my writing across north and south America
