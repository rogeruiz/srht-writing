Iâ€˜m Roger, a software engineer. I'm so glad you're here. This site is a where I
do most of my technical writing and discuss a bit of my experiences at the
places I've worked.

_Also_, this site is bilingual, like me. You can find a translation to Spanish on the
upper-right corner if it's available. If it's not, then reach out to me and
maybe I'll write one up. For the most part, I try to translate everything
between the two languages to help spread my reach across folks interested in my
writing across north and south America
