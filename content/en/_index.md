I'm so glad you're here. This website is where I publish my technical writing
along with a deeper overview of my experience that I can't fit into my resume.

I use a variety of techniques in my technical writing to make things easier to
read. An example is the heavy use of `<details />` HTML elements to allow
readers to dive deeper into certain topics. There's also the use of
[BeOS-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS) labels on `<code />` blocks
which help readers understand what the code is doing or what file is being
discussed.

_Also_, this site is **bilingual, like me**. You can find a translation to
Spanish on the upper-right corner or the bottom of the page, if it's available.
If it's not, then {{< mailto
email="hi@rog.gr"
subject="Oye, parce. Quiero que escribas algo en espaÃ±ol" >}}
reach out to me{{</ mailto >}} so I know there's interest in it. For the most
part, I try to translate everything between the two languages to help spread my
reach across folks interested in my writing across north and south America
