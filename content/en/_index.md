I‘m Roger Steve Ruiz, an L4 software engineer at TrussWorks building
user-centered digital services. I am a self-taught software engineer that found
my place in web development by coming in through the window, specifically the
browser window. Coming from a traditional graphic design background, CSS and
systems design were two things that felt as natural as color theory and
typography. As I learned more about the history of and fundamentals of
programming, I made my transition to full-stack web development with a strong
focus on front-end, back-end, infrastructure, and automation. I try to add
elements of the emotional in a world of the artificial. We’re all people who
work on computers, or sometimes inside the computers e.g. cloud, and it is easy
to forget that people at the end of the day are the ones using them. My career
has taken me from the private sector to the public sector. I enjoy both kinds of
work, although the latter I find has the most to improve on and biggest impact.

Currently, my career path has me in more senior roles. I’m mostly focused on
release engineering and building the necessary infrastructure and processes to
help teams ship and iterate on software. I feel comfortable on-boarding on teams
to better understand how to contribute. I find myself consistently working on a
lot of different projects and being the glue interconnecting them.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
}
