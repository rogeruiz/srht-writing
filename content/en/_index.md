I'm so glad you're here. I use this to publish my technical writing along with
my resume and professional experience.

_Also_, this site is **bilingual, like me**. You can find a translation to
Spanish on the upper-right corner or the bottom of the page, if it's available.
If it's not, then {{< mailto
email="hi@rog.gr"
subject="Oye, parce. Quiero que escribas algo en espaÃ±ol" >}}
reach out to me{{</ mailto >}} and maybe I'll write one up. For the most part, I
try to translate everything between the two languages to help spread my reach
across folks interested in my writing across north and south America
