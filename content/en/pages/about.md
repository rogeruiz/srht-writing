I am a highly experienced software engineer with an impressive track record
spanning over 12 years in the field of web development. Throughout my career,
I've cultivated a deep expertise in this ever-evolving digital landscape. My
journey commenced with a strong foundation in traditional graphic design, where
concepts like CSS and systems design were second nature to me, much like my
command of color theory and typography. Over time, I've seamlessly evolved into
a full-stack web developer, specializing in front-end, back-end, infrastructure,
and automation.

My unwavering mission is to infuse a distinct human touch into the digital
realm, a constant reminder that technology ultimately serves people. In a world
where we interact with computers daily, and sometimes even work within the
virtual 'cloud,' it's paramount to remember that real individuals are the
ultimate end-users of these technologies. Throughout my career, I've embarked on
diverse adventures in both the private and public sectors, thriving on the
unique challenges each realm presents. My heart has always leaned towards the
public sector, driven by the belief in its potential for significant
transformation and impact.

Recently, I reached a pivotal milestone in my journey as I transitioned into
staff+ engineering roles. This new chapter has allowed me to leverage my
extensive experience to make contributions in the areas of release engineering
for open-source projects and the development of critical infrastructure and
processes. I excel in seamlessly integrating into teams and gaining a deep
understanding of how to contribute effectively while working in the open. My
professional journey continues to lead me to diverse projects, where I serve
as the linchpin that connects and unifies them, driving progress,
innovation, and positive change.
