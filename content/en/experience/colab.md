I was hired on a temporary basis to help the CEO understand how to mentor and
level up their software development team. The company at the time was focused on
WordPress and JavaScript technologies. While at this company, I helped by
generating documentation and templates for projects to be completed more
efficiently along with training their development team to have a process to
create their own tooling with languages that their development teams understood
including PHP and JavaScript.
