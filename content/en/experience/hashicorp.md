As a senior software engineer at HashiCorp, I worked on the Terraform Enterprise
(TFE) product offering. In this role, I sat in on customer support calls and
researched how to implement automated customer installations of TFE across
various public and private clouds. My main focus while here was working within
AWS and Azure along with some tooling around working within SELinux and VMWare
ESXi.

My main focus on this team was contributing to architecture and system design
along with implementing the quickest solutions to customer's demands.
