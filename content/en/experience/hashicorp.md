As a senior software engineer at HashiCorp, I worked on the *Terraform
Enterprise* (TFE) product team. In this role, I sat in on customer support calls
& researched how to best implement automated customer installations of TFE
across various public & private clouds. My main focus while there was working
with *AWS* & *Azure* along with some authoring tooling for working with
*SELinux* & *VMWare ESXi*.

> One of my primary responsibilities was to contribute to the architecture &
> system design of TFE. This involved understanding the inner-workings of the
> TFC offering & devising solutions that would enhance its performance &
> scalability when operated by engineers outside of HashiCorp.
>
> To meet this task, I delved deep into the architecture of TFE, dissecting its
> components & identifying areas for improvement. Drawing upon my expertise in
> operating & maintaining software systems, I proposed enhancements that would
> optimize resource utilization & bolster the TFE instance's reliability.

Additionally, recognizing the importance of accessibility & flexibility, I
documented a custom air-gapped installation process for TFE using *Squid*. This
comprehensive guide provided users with clear instructions on how to deploy the
platform in environments with restricted internet access, thereby expanding its
usability & appeal across particular customers.

I collaborated closely with customer support engineers to refine our feedback
loop. By actively seeking insights from customers, I gained valuable perspective
on common challenges & pain points. Leveraging this feedback, I help implement
iterative improvements to TFE, ensuring that user concerns were addressed
promptly & effectively.

> As part of my efforts to foster growth & efficiency within the team, I
> spearheaded initiatives to enhance developer on-boarding processes. By
> revamping our training materials & streamlining on-boarding procedures, I
> facilitated the seamless integration of new team members, allowing us to scale
> our team size by 50%.

Through these concerted actions, I made significant contributions to the
advancement of TFE. My involvement in system design & architecture laid the
foundation for a more robust & scalable platform, capable of meeting the
evolving needs of users. The documentation of the air-gapped installation
process expanded the platform's reach, making it accessible to users operating
in highly-regulated environments.

Moreover, my collaboration with customer support engineers led to tangible
improvements in our feedback loop, resulting in more responsive & user-centric
development practices. Finally, by enhancing developer on-boarding processes, I
facilitated the expansion of our team, ensuring that we had the resources &
expertise needed to drive continued growth & success.
