At the General Services Administration (GSA), I worked as a GS 15 federal
employee with a specialization in automation and tooling along with web
application development. My time working on GSA projects included taking
assessments of software solutions that were abandoned at other federal agencies.
I also contributed to the engineering culture and practice by conducting
workshops, presentations, and writing documentation to help guide and steer the
engineering teams across 18F.

One of my proudest contributions here was guiding our customized Python web
application for time-keeping through the Authority to Operate (ATO) process in
roughly 8 weeks.

While working here, I split my time across cloud.gov and GSA / TTS / 18F
activities.
