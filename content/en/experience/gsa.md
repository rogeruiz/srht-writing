As a *full-stack software engineer*, I played a pivotal role in maintaining &
advancing several critical open-source software projects, including notable
initiatives like *vote.gov* & the *US Web Design System*. These projects were
instrumental in modernizing government services & enhancing user experiences
across various platforms.

> One of my significant contributions was as a founding engineer for both the
> [**vote.gov**](https://vote.gov) portal & the [**US Web Design
> System**](https://designsystem.digital.gov). In these roles, I was tasked with
> architecting the initial framework & laying the groundwork for these
> government modernization initiatives. Additionally, I bootstrapped &
> maintained various open-source projects, ensuring their continued development
> & relevance in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

To ensure the success & sustainability of these projects, I took proactive
measures in designing & implementing a robust release process. This involved
establishing streamlined procedures for deploying updates & new features while
maintaining high standards of quality & reliability. I also conducted training
sessions to equip engineers with the skills & knowledge needed to operate &
maintain the release process independently, empowering them to contribute
effectively to project development.

> Also, I spearheaded efforts to secure the [**Authority to Operate**
> (ATO)](https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-to-ato/) for the
> [**18F**](https://18f.gsa.gov/) internal time-keeping SaaS, known as
> [**Tock**](https://github.com/18F/tock), which was built using **Django**.
> This involved working closely with stakeholders to address compliance
> requirements & ensure the platform's adherence to regulatory standards.

Through my role as a founding engineer for various projects & my contributions
to various open-source projects, I played a pivotal role in advancing digital
innovation within the government sector. By architecting essential frameworks,
establishing release processes, & securing ATOs for critical platforms, I helped
pave the way for the modernization of government services & the improvement of
user experiences. Additionally, my efforts in managing & mentoring a team of
engineers contributed to their professional growth & development, ensuring the
sustainability & success of these initiatives in the long term.
