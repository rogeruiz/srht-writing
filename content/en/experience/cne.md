At Condé Nast Entertainment, I worked on a small team of six engineers to build
out the "The Scene" video portal. While here, I helped design and architect the
video site using EmberJS with a Ruby on Rails backend. In this role, I helped
with tooling to catch updates across our various internal libraries to have them
remain up to date. I also worked closely with the DevOps engineers to create
Vagrant boxes to allow for easier developer environments across the team.
