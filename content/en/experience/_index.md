Here's a list of the places I've worked. My career has taken me all across the
software development stack as well as to some interesting edges around
infrastructure, security, & compliance.

> I've been told that I have **"full full-stack experience"**. Others call it
> **DevOps**. I think of myself as a curious learner willing to dive into
> complex problems as I need to in order to delivery solutions on-time in a
> cost-effective way.

While I prefer working within a web application domain, I am open to new
opportunities outside of building for the web. In recent years, I've been
thinking more about how to help with developer experience & internal product
teams as part of a platform offering. As I've grown through my career, I've
realized that I do my best work in supporting & growing engineering teams while
also contributing to the technically.
