Here's a list of the places I've worked. My career has taken me all across the
software development stack along with to some interesting edges around
infrastructure, security, and compliance.

While I prefer working within a web application domain, I am open to new
opportunities outside of building for the web. In recent years, I've been
thinking more about how to help with developer experience. It's something that's
always interested me since I do it for myself as well. I write a lot about my
own experiences [on my blog]({{< relref "writing" >}}). So check it out if
you're interested.
