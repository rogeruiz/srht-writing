At cloud.gov, I worked as a site reliability engineer with a focus on
integrations and tooling. I conducted on-call rotations, incident responses, and
application development to help build, maintain, and operate the cloud.gov PaaS
on AWS commercial and **GovCloud**. While cloud.gov was being built, we had to also
take into account **FedRamp JAB** authorization and compliance in order to support
**FISMA Low** and **FISMA Moderate** systems running on the platform.

While working here, I was also an **engineering manager for a team of 5 to 8
engineers to ease the burden of other engineering managers who were unfamiliar
with the technology we were using**. I was involved in hiring for this team as
well and would delegate different aspects of the interview process in a balanced
way across the team depending on the necessary knowledge.

I also conducted workshops and presentations for the upcoming features around
cloud.gov to gain broader adoption across US federal agencies.
