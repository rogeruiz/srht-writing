In my role as a *site reliability engineer* (SRE), I contributed & lead the
development, maintenance, & operation of a *Platform-as-a-Service* (PaaS)
utilizing the open-source software *Cloud Foundry*. This involved overseeing the
creation & management of a robust infrastructure to support the platform's
functionalities. To effectively deploy *Cloud Foundry*, we leveraged *Bosh* for
VM orchestration & *ConcourseCI* for delivering updates to the PaaS.

As part of my responsibilities, I managed a team comprising 8 engineers with
diverse specializations. My aim was to help coordinate their efforts towards the
successful implementation & enhancement of our PaaS solution. This involved
delegating tasks, providing guidance, & ensuring smooth collaboration among team
members.

> our adherence to stringent regulatory standards, ensuring the platform's
> suitability for hosting sensitive government systems.

> You can see these *Diagrams as Code* at
> [https://diagrams.fr.☁️.gov/](https://diagrams.fr.cloud.gov/).

To facilitate broader adoption of our platform across the US federal government,
I led training sessions & workshops focused on showcasing *cloud.gov* features.
These sessions were designed to educate stakeholders about the capabilities &
benefits of our PaaS solution, encouraging its integration into various
government agencies.

> I actively participated in on-call rotations & incident response training to
> ensure the platform's reliability & resilience. This involved promptly
> addressing any issues or emergencies that arose, implementing effective
> solutions, & refining incident response procedures for future incidents.

Through our concerted efforts, we successfully built & maintained a robust PaaS
solution using *Cloud Foundry*. By managing a skilled team of engineers,
designing compliance diagrams, conducting training sessions, & actively
participating in incident response activities, we achieved broader adoption of
*cloud.gov* across the US federal government. Our platform's reliability,
security, & user-friendly features positioned it as a trusted choice for hosting
critical government systems, contributing to the modernization of digital
services in the public sector.
