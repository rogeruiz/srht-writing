Building, maintaining, and supporting ☁️.gov with a small team. This was my first
introduction to site reliability engineering practices with extensive Linux
troubleshooting. I also leveraged Kubernetes, BOSH, Cloud Foundry, and Concourse
CI along with Ruby, JavaScript, Golang, and Python to continously deliver a
Platform as a Service for federal government agencies.

At cloud.gov, I worked as a site reliability engineer with a focus on
integrations and tooling. I conducted on-call rotations, incident responses, and
application development to help build, maintain, and operate the cloud.gov PaaS
on AWS commercial and GovCloud. While cloud.gov was being built, we had to also
take into account FedRamp JAB authorization and compliance in order to support
FISMA Low and FISMA Moderate systems running on the platform.

While working here, I was also an engineering manager for the team of 5 to 12
engineers to ease the burden of other engineering managers who were unfamiliar
with the technology we were using. I was involved in hiring for this team as
well and would delegate different aspects of the hiring process in a balanced
way across the team depending on the necessary knowledge.

I also conducted workshops and presentations for the upcoming features around
cloud.gov to gain broader adoption across US federal agencies.
