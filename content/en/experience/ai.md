As a consultant for Alexander Interactive, now known by a different name of Cake
& Arrow, I worked on a few projects which were under very strict and tight
deadlines. The main work was organizing and refactoring some of the more
complicated code that was left behind by a front-end engineer who unexpected
left the company.

My skills were specifically requested in order for the agency to fulfill their
deliverables on-time. I worked in various different client-side build systems
while also integrating the hundreds of HTML and Twig templates into a Laravel
backend.
