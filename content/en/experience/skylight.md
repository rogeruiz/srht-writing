As a staff engineer on the EpiSync project for the CDC at Skylight, I'm
responsible for contributing to multiple codebases across various programming
languages and development environments. With most of the of the team split
between _macOS_ and _Windows_ development environments, I've had to create
documentation, run books, and automation that works across _Unix_ and
_PowerShell_ terminal environments.

Another responsibility on this team is to help guide and maintain long-standing
documentation and architectural diagrams. Using tools such as _Structurizr_ &
_Docker_, I've managed to create a local development intranet for team members
to load up locally to view system diagrams, run books, and architectural
decision records in a single location. This has helped improve communication
across disciplines on the project.

With _Just_, I am also building out an ergonomic way with shared language for
helping engineers on my team develop, troubleshoot, and operate software needed
to make them effective with day-to-day tasks. One of the more recent recipes
I've written allows engineers to refresh and modify JWT tokens locally so they
can work with an bearer-token authenticated API locally and within a
private-network development environment accessible only through a remote desktop
environment.
