Performed at a staff-level individual contributor across multiple projects at
TrussWorks including a DoD project and various internal projects such as
documenting the engineering experience at the company along with its popular
open-source project named React-USWDS.

As a full-stack engineer, I contributed to the architecture, technical design,
and implementation of various client-side and server-side solutions. I also
contributed to some infrastructure and security work as well on AWS GovCloud and
integrations with 3rd-party vendors and adjacent DoD internal agencies.

I was CASP+ certified within the first 6 weeks of joining the company so I could
achieve my IAT II and IASAE II certifications to be able to review code changes
across the multiple private and public repositories. This work can be found
under the Transcom organization on GitHub and my work for Truss can be found
under the TrussWorks organization on GitHub.
