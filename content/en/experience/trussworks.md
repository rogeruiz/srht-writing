Operating at a principal IC level, I was hired specifically for the MilMove
project. I gained my CASP+ 3.0 certification within six weeks of employment in
order to effectively contribute to the DoD USTC code base at DoD IAE II and
IASAE II certification levels.

I've worked on various roles across TrussWorks and within the MilMove project
across multiple practices such as Product, Design, Engineering, and Security. I
facilitate large and small working groups and committees. I also share the
maintainer role for the React USWDS open-source project.

I mentor and guide clients, engineers, and other colleagues through the Agile
and government compliance practices for operating and maintaining US government
information systems.

As mentioned above, I also contribute to both the application engineering and
infrastructure security engineering practices found at TrussWorks. I've even
been able to successfully introduce and shepherd novel practices such as
documentation as code and diagrams as code along with open-source community
engagement best practices.
