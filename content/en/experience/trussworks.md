As an engineering leader experienced in both infrastructure security &
application engineering practices, I found myself in a unique position where I
could be at the helm of bridging the *application engineering* & *infrastructure
security engineering* teams at TrussWorks. Part of this included getting *IAT
II* & *IASAE II* certified by getting *CASP+* certified within the first 2
months of joining the company.

> My primary responsibility was to lead two cross-functional teams comprised of
> application engineers & infrastructure engineers to achieve our mission.
> TrussWorks had been working for five years to launch, secure, & continue
> building features to the MilMove system. This project was written in with a
> **Go** back-end & automation tooling with a **JavaScript** / **React**
> front-end using **React Query**. The API was maintained using **Swagger** to
> generate API endpoints for communication between the client & server.

To ensure seamless collaboration & knowledge sharing among team members, I
helped architect comprehensive project & company-wide documentation portals.
These centralized repositories became invaluable resources, facilitating
smoother workflows & fostering a culture of transparency & information
accessibility.

Additionally, I took the initiative to organize & facilitate various weekly
& monthly meetings covering diverse topics such as mentorship, front-end
development, back-end development, & Linux. With attendance consistently
exceeding 10 colleagues, these gatherings served as vibrant forums for
brainstorming, knowledge exchange, & professional growth for everyone
involved..

Recognizing the importance of career mentorship & development, I dedicated
significant time & effort to provide guidance & support to engineers
specializing across infrastructure, security, & application development.
Through 1:1 sessions, personalized coaching, & structured career planning, I
endeavored to empower my team members to reach their full potential & achieve
their professional aspirations.

Additionally, I played a pivotal role in driving process & technical
improvements across projects & the engineering department as a whole. I drafted
& published Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), outlining proposed
enhancements & innovations aimed at enhancing efficiency, scalability, & overall
performance.

Through the meticulous execution of these actions, the results were
transformative. The centralized documentation portals became the cornerstone of
our operations, significantly streamlining communication & knowledge-sharing
processes across teams. Our meetings evolved into vibrant hubs of collaboration
& learning, sparking innovative ideas & fostering a culture of continuous
improvement.

> Additionally, I implemented robust incident response management protocols &
> conducted regular training sessions to ensure our team was well-prepared to
> handle emergencies effectively. These proactive measures not only bolstered
> our ability to mitigate risks & minimize downtime but also instilled
> confidence & readiness among team members, further enhancing our operational
> resilience.

The personalized mentorship & career development initiatives bore fruit as
team members flourished in their roles, taking on greater responsibilities &
advancing their careers within the company. This not only boosted morale &
retention but also enhanced the overall skill level & expertise of the
engineering workforce.

Moreover, the implementation of ADRs led to tangible improvements in project
efficiency, reliability, & scalability. With each decision grounded in careful
analysis & foresight, we were able to navigate complex technical challenges
with confidence, driving the company's engineering capabilities while still
delivering features on-time.

In essence, by diligently implementing these strategies, we not only achieved
our immediate goals but also laid the foundation for sustained success &
innovation in the engineering practices at TrussWorks.
