This was my first job in tech. I worked on creating HTML templates to be
integrated with various PHP-based server-side frameworks along with Java-based
web frameworks for certain clients. While here, I also helped modernize the
source control technology that the company used by offering training and
documentation. I also helped more senior engineers build, operate, and maintain
a Gitolite instance to provide Git repositories from within the company without
having to rely on SaaS providers.

I also introduced new-at-the-time processes to allow for transpilation /
compilation of tools such as CoffeeScript and Sass.
