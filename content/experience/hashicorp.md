As a Senior software engineer on the Private Terraform Enterprise SaaS product
at HashiCorp, I worked remotely on a small team of 100% distributed members
across America and western Europe

I specialized in creating testing best practices and repeatable use of the
Terraform product to develop and deliver the Terraform Enterprise SaaS product.
I advocated for developer tooling and gated automation along with Agile best
practices for collaborating across UTC-7 and UTC+1 time zones. I also helped
setup the on-boarding guide for the team.
